# Amaterasu Project Source Code

The implementations of the three predictive models we developed as part of the Capstone assignment in ENGR 100-Practical Data Science for Engineers

## Purpose

Our task for this project was to develop multiple solar forecasting model to predict radiation over time and determine the best model to use for this situation. To this end we implemented 3 different models: *a Random Forest Model*, a *K-Nearest Neighbors Model*, and a *Perceptron Model*


## Usage
Clone the directory and it your current directory. Next enter ```Python amaterasu.py``` into the command line.
